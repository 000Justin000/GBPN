# Graph Belief Propagation Networks

The graph belief propagation networks is a family of graph neural networks models for node classification.
They are accurate, interpretable, and oftentimes converge to a stationary solution as the number of BP steps increase.

## Environment

The implementations in this repository are tested under Python 3.8, PyTorch version 1.6.0, and Cuda 10.2.
To setup the environment, simply run the following:

```setup
bash install_requirements.sh
```

This command installs PyTorch Geometric, and compiles the sub-sampling algorithm written in C++.

## Training

To train the model(s) in the paper, run this command:

```train
python train.py --input-data <path_to_data> --alpha 10 --beta 20
```

>ðŸ“‹  Describe how to train the models, with example commands on how to train the models in your paper, including the full training procedure and appropriate hyperparameters.

## Evaluation

To evaluate my model on ImageNet, run:

```eval
python eval.py --model-file mymodel.pth --benchmark imagenet
```

>ðŸ“‹  Describe how to evaluate the trained models on benchmarks reported in the paper, give commands that produce the results (section below).

## Pre-trained Models

You can download pretrained models here:

- [My awesome model](https://drive.google.com/mymodel.pth) trained on ImageNet using parameters x,y,z. 

>ðŸ“‹  Give a link to where/how the pretrained models can be downloaded and how they were trained (if applicable).  Alternatively you can have an additional column in your results table with a link to the models.

## Results

Our model achieves the following performance on :
