# Graph Belief Propagation Networks

The graph belief propagation networks (GBPNs) is a family of graph neural networks models for node classification.
They are accurate, interpretable, and converge to a stationary solution as the number of BP steps increase.

## Environment Setup

The implementations in this repository are tested under Python 3.8, PyTorch version 1.6.0, and Cuda 10.2.
To setup the environment, simply run the following:

```setup
bash install_requirements.sh
```

This command installs PyTorch Geometric, and compiles the sub-sampling algorithm written in C++.
Note PyTorch Geometric may fail to initialize ([issue](https://github.com/rusty1s/pytorch_geometric/issues/999)) if there are multiple versions of PyTorch installed.
Therefore, we highly recommend the users to start with a new conda environment.

## Basic Usage

A GBPN model consists of a MLP that maps features on each node to its self-potential, and a coupling matrix.
It can be defined in the same way as any PyTorch Module.

```python
model = GBPN(num_features, num_classes, dim_hidden=dim_hidden, num_layers=num_layers, activation=nn.ReLU(), dropout_p=dropout_p, lossfunc_BP=0, deg_scaling=False, learn_H=True)
```

Here, the MLP has input dimension _num\_features_, output dimension _num\_classes_, and hidden dimension _dim\_hidden_

## Evaluation

To evaluate my model on ImageNet, run:

```eval
python eval.py --model-file mymodel.pth --benchmark imagenet
```
